# Receive Sound Data from Bluetooth A2DP

We receive some music via Bluetooth e.g. from your mobile phone and push it out on I2S: Something that the A2DP library does out of the box.
However we just test this function here because the implementation runs via some additional buffers. The critical setting here is to make sure that the buffer for StreamCopy is big enough: we use 4100 bytes.
 
### External DAC:

For my tests I am using the 24-bit PCM5102 PCM5102A Stereo DAC Digital-to-analog Converter PLL Voice Module pHAT

I am just using the default pins defined by the framework. However I could change them with the help of the config object. The mute pin can be defined in the constructor of the I2SStream - by not defining anything we use the default which is GPIO23

 
| DAC     |  ESP32
| --------| ---------------
| VDD     |  5V
| GND     |  GND
| SD      |  OUT (GPIO22)
| L/R     |  GND
| WS      |  WS (GPIO15)
| SCK     |  BCK (GPIO14)
| FMT     |  GND 
| XSMT     | GPIO23 


- DEMP - De-emphasis control for 44.1kHz sampling rate(1): Off (Low) / On (High)
- FLT - Filter select : Normal latency (Low) / Low latency (High)
- SCK - System clock input (probably SCL on your board).
- FMT - Audio format selection : I2S (Low) / Left justified (High)
- XSMT - Soft mute control(1): Soft mute (Low) / soft un-mute (High)
